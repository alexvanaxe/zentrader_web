ng serve --disable-host-check --host 192.168.15.3

To build on amazon there is a problem regarding memory. To solve this create a swap file as follows:
create swap

sudo /bin/dd if=/dev/zero of=/var/swap.1 bs=1M count=1024
sudo /sbin/mkswap /var/swap.1
sudo chmod 600 /var/swap.1
sudo /sbin/swapon /var/swap.1

If you need more than 1024 then change that to something higher.

To enable it by default after reboot, add this line to /etc/fstab:

/var/swap.1 swap swap defaults 0 0

ng build --prod --build-optimizer=false


####

To persist the process

# loginctl enable-linger <user>

We are using systemd to manage the processess for now
